## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## PURPOSE
# Conducting *correlation tests* between primate bone *morphology* (FemurHead, NSA, etc.) variables and *range of motion* (Abduction, AbductedKnee) variables. This will help us understand the relationships between morphology and range of motion in primate hips, which in turn helps us understand why primates move in different ways.


## INSTRUCTIONS
# *Correlation tests* are used to evaluate the relationships between variables. 

# We will be calculating the *Correlation Coefficients* between all the bone morphology variables and the two range of motion (ROM) variables for all species in our primate dataset.
# We will use the *Spearman rho Correlation* (or Spearman Rank Correlation) method because our data are likely not normally distributed (meaning that they do not follow a nice bell curve). This is called a non-parametric test.

# To do this in R, we will use the *cor() function*, which follows this format:
# cor(x, y, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
# In this format:
# x and y are numeric variables; For us, x will be a morphology variable and y will be a ROM variable.
# method specifies our correlation method (Spearman).
# use = "complete.obs" tells R how to handle missing or NA values in the data.

# A correlation coefficient is always a number between -1 and 1. If a correlation coefficient is:
# close to -1, then there is a strong *negative* correlation between the two variables (as x increases, y decreases).
# close to 0, then there is no relationship/correlation between the two variables.
# close to 1, then there is a strong *positive* correlation between the two variables (as x increases, y increases). 

# In your group, you will calculate the correlation coefficients for EACH morphology variable vs. EITHER Abduction or Abducted Knee Position. Interpret the results to determine which morphology variables are most correlated with the range of motion variables.
# Group 1 (Sophie, Haesu, Miranda): Calculate morphology variable correlations to the *Abduction* ROM variable.
# Group 2 (Nyla, Wylie, Hanora): Calculate morphology variable correlations to the *AbductedKnee* ROM variable.

## WORKFLOW
# 1. Import the full primate dataset from your GitHub folder (PrimateMorphROMData_Full.csv):
```{r}
pri.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
pri.dat
```

# 2. Use the cor() function to calculate the Spearman rho Correlation Coefficient between EACH morphology variable (15 variables total) and your group's assigned ROM variable (EITHER Abduction OR AbductedKnee). Write each correlation coefficient next to your code with a #.
```{r}
#Example:
#cor(pri.dat$FemurHead, pri.dat$Abduction, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs") # rho = 0.1932215

# Your turn:
FH_abk <- cor(pri.dat$FemurHead, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
FH_abk # 0.8760508
NSA_abk <- cor(pri.dat$NSA, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
NSA_abk #0.3677103
N_abk <- cor(pri.dat$Neck, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
N_abk #0.8868355
L2_abk <- cor(pri.dat$L2, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
L2_abk # 0.8796852
L4_abk <- cor(pri.dat$L4, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
L4_abk #0.7743667
FTA_abk <- cor(pri.dat$FTA, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
FTA_abk # 0.4101063
PS_abk <- cor(pri.dat$PS, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
PS_abk #0.8532604
PI_abk <- cor(pri.dat$PI, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
PI_abk #0.9019763
AS_abk <- cor(pri.dat$AS, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
AS_abk #0.8266896
AI_abk <- cor(pri.dat$AI, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
AI_abk #0.8690522
TA_abk <- cor(pri.dat$TotalArea, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
TA_abk #0.8911795
SUP_abk <- cor(pri.dat$SUP, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
SUP_abk #-0.4891056
ANT_abk <- cor(pri.dat$ANT, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
ANT_abk #0.1134793
AD_abk <- cor(pri.dat$AcetabDiameter, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
AD_abk #0.8963421
PB_abk <- cor(pri.dat$PelvicBreadth, pri.dat$AbductedKnee, method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
PB_abk #0.8695689
```

# 3. List which morphology variables are MOST STRONGLY correlated to your ROM variable. Specify if these are positive or negative correlations.
```{r}
#ones excluded have weak correlations (there are few) -> most correlations overall are positive (1 is negative)
FH_abk # 0.8760508
N_abk #0.8868355
L2_abk # 0.8796852
L4_abk #0.7743667
PS_abk #0.8532604
PI_abk #0.9019763
AS_abk #0.8266896
AI_abk #0.8690522
TA_abk #0.8911795
AD_abk #0.8963421
PB_abk #0.8695689
```

# 4. What do your results mean in real life? What have we learned about the relationships between morphologies and range of motion in primate hips? Interpret your correlation coefficients from above with words.
```{r}
#for most morphology variables, the strong correlations mean that the greater the greater the size of variable (size of FH, length of Neck, etc.), the greater the ROM, in this case the range of knee abduction.
```
