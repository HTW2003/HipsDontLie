## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Plots of Papio ROM and Morphology data

#uploading data
```{r}
#vars for ROM data and Morph data
pap_ROM <- read.csv(file.choose())
pap_Morph <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

#plots for statistical variables
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
truehist(pap_Morph$FemurHead, main = "Femurhead truehist")
lines(density(pap_Morph$FemurHead))
hist(pap_Morph$FemurHead, main = "Femurhead hist")
#I have no idea as to whether or not I'm making a proper sfplot
#what do i compare it to?
sunflowerplot(pap_Morph$FemurHead, data = pap_Morph, main = "Femurhead sunflowerplot")
```

#qqPlot
```{r}
#really just spitballing here
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
qqplot(pap_ROM$Abduction, pap_ROM$Adduction)
qqplot(pap_ROM$ThighCircumference, pap_ROM$ThighLength)
